  "description": "The time-height plot of eastward, northward and vertical wind data in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (52-122 km) estimated from the MF radar observations at Pameungpeuk, Indonesia (7.65S, 107.69E). File names of gif data are composed of date: (year)(month)(day)_pam.gif (daily plot), and (year)(month)_pam.gif (monthly plot). These plots are made using the netCDF data. For daily and monthly plots, the wind data are averaged for 10 minutes and 6 hours in each height, respectively. The 6-hour average is done if there are more than 20 valid data points in 6-hour window (0-5, 6-11, 12-17, and 18-23h) for each height. Detailed description of the netCDF data can be found in the metadata. Universal time is used for time data.",
