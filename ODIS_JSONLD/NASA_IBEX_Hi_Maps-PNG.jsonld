  "description": "As of this writing (11/5/2010), this product \nhad been issued by the IBEX team in two releases. \nRelease 1 IBEX-Hi map data are superseded by Release 2\ndata which are more time-extensive (12 months vs. 6 months)\nand are richer in content.  While Release 1 IBEX-Hi map data \nand their documentation remain accessible at\nftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/digital_data/release_1/\nand\nftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/images/release_1/,\nthis description supports the retrieval and use of Release 2 data only.\n\nThe Release_2 IBEX-Hi map data contain all-sky 6 deg x 6 deg \nresolution maps in J2000 ecliptic coordinates of energetic \nneutral fluxes reaching the near-Earth IBEX spacecraft from \nthe distant heliosphere and heliosheath.  Maps \nare in both a spacecraft frame and, via Compton-Getting \ncorrections, a heliospheric frame.  Basic maps are each \naccumulated over 6-months duration, so far for epochs 1 \n(12/2008-06/2009) and 2 (06/2009-12/2009).  Maps are available \nfor five of the energy bands of IBEX-Hi (0.52-0.95, 0.84-1.55, \n1.36-2.50, 1.99-3.75, 3.13-6.00 keV) and, for the heliospheric \nframe only, also for six monoenergetic points (0.71, 1.11, 1.74, \n2.73, 3.0, 4.29 keV).  In addition, monoenergetic maps are available\nas summed over the data collected during epochs 1 and 2 combined.\nAll maps are available in digital text format and in PNG image format\n(considered as separate data sets within VEPO).\n\nGiven that VHO/VEPO typically displays clickable granule (file)\nnames for any given specification of data product and time span,\nand given that IBEX-Hi digital maps and PNG-formatted display\nmaps are each considered single data products, a request for data\nfrom either product will yield .GE.20 names of files containing data\nspanning or within the requested time span.  For IBEX, the names\nshown by VHO/VEPO actually have the form subdirectory/filename.\nThe subdirectories are named map1, map1cg, map2, map2cg, and\nmap-combined.  Maps involving \"1\" (\"2\") are from the first (second)\n6-month epoch, while \"combined\" means composed of data taken\nduring epochs 1 and 2.  Maps involving (not involving) \"cg\" means\nheliospheric frame (spacecraft frame).  In the first four subdirectories,\nfile names are of the forms ha60.hide-trp-flux100-hi-N-flux.ext and\nha60.hide-trp-mono_80-P.PP-flux.ext, where \"ext\" is \"png\" or \"txt\"\naccording to which product is requested,  N is the energy step\nnumber for the IBEX-Hi instrument (2-6), P.PP is the energy level,\nin keV, of a monoenergetic flux.
