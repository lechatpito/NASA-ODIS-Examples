  "description": "This  dataset contains spectrograms plots of ULF waves from Skibotn ground station, in circular components in DHV system. D is the horizontal component to the East , H is the horizontal component to the North, V (Z) is the output vertical. DC magnetic field being close to Z, wave polarisation mode is given by amplitude of right and left component. If the two component are equal, this is a linear mode.\nAt the bottom of figure, the curve shows the integrated power of the perpendicular and parallel components with respect to the DC magnetic field (~Z).",
