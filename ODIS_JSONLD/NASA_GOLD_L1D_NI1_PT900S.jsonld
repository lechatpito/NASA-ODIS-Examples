  "description": "Level 1D files contain a combined thumbnail image that contains 4 nightside images using the low resolution slit: 1356 Angstrom, LBH Short (denoted LBH1), \n   LBH Long (denoted LBH2), and solar zenith angle. Separate files are created for Channel A and Channel B data. A new L1D file \n   is generated for each new L1C file. These can correspond to either the Northern or Southern hemisphere.\n   Combined file definition (image size = 1024 x 1024 pixels)\n   - 1356 brightness map (in Rayleighs) integrates the signal from 133 to 137 nm.\n   - LBH band 1 brightness map (in Rayleighs) integrates the signal from 140 to 148 nm.\n   - LBH band 2 brightness map (in Rayleighs) integrates the signal from 150 to 160 nm.",
