  "description": "This data product consists of daily sets of four\nimages created from SOLIS Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) data: \n(a) photospheric longitudinal magnetic field, based on FeI 630.15 \nand 630.25 nm lines; (b) photospheric vector magnetic field, based \non FeI 630.15 and 630.25 nm lines; (c) chromospheric equivalent\nwidths based on the HeI 1083.0 nm line; (d) lower chromosphere\nlongitudinal magnetic field based on the CaII 854.2 nm lines.\nSome recent data are \"quick look\" while most data are based on \nMilne-Eddington inversions.  The data are available as both JPEG \nimages for browsing and as FITS files for quantitative work.",
