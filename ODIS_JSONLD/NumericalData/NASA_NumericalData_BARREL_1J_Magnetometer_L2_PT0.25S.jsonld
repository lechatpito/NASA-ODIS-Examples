  "description": "Three axis DC magnetometer data with nominal conversions applied. Data are neither gain corrected nor despun.\n\nThe BARREL Mission was a multiple-balloon investigation designed to study electron losses from Earth's Radiation Belts. Selected as a NASA Living with a Star Mission of Opportunity, BARREL was designed to augment the Radiation Belt Storm Probes, RBSP, mission by providing measurements of the spatial and temporal variations of electron precipitation from the radiation belts. The RBSP mission has since been renamed the Van Allen Probes mission. Each BARREL balloon carried an X-ray spectrometer to measure the bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by precipitating relativistic electrons as they collide with neutrals in the atmosphere, and a DC magnetometer to measure ULF-timescale variations of the magnetic field. BARREL observations collected near latitudes close to either the antarctic and arctic circles at stratospheric altitudes at about 30 km. The BARREL instrumentation provided the first balloon measurements of relativistic electron precipitation while comprehensive in situ measurements of both plasma waves and energetic particles were available. Also, the BARREL data has been used to characterize the spatial scale of precipitation at relativistic energies.\n\nThe initial pair of balloon campaigns that were conducted initially during the Austral summer months of January and February of 2013 and 2014 with launches from two stations located in Antarctica: the British base located at Halley Bay on the Brunt Ice Shelf and the South African SANAE IV base (SANAE stand for South African National Antarctic Expedition) located in Vesleskarvet, Queen Maud Land. For the 2013 and 2014 the balloon campaigns, the launch plan was designed to maintain an array with about five payloads spread across about six hours of magnetic local time, MLT, in the region that magnetically maps to the radiation belts. Thus, the BARREL balloon constellation constituted an evolving and slowly moving array able to study relativistic electron precipitation from the radiation belts.\n\nLater campaigns were undertaken in 2015 and 2016 from the Esrange Space Center located in Kiruna, Sweden. The 2015 and 2016 campaigns were undertaken in coordination with the Van Allen Probes mission, the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association, EISCAT, incoherent scatter radar system, and other ground and space based instruments. Seven balloon launches occurred during the August 2015 BARREL campaign. A total of eight flights occurred during August 2016.\n\nSumming over the four BARREL campaigns, over 50 small, approximately 20 kg, stratospheric balloons were successively launched. The website creeated and hosted by A.J. Halford (see Information URL below) reports that: \"By the end of the campaigns, there were over 90 researchers coordinating on a daily basis with the BARREL team working on 7 different satellite missions, 1 other balloon mission, and way too many ground based instruments to count.\" Although the BARREL mission launched only balloons during the years from 2013 to 2016, research using data collected on these flights is ongoing, so stay tuned for updates!
