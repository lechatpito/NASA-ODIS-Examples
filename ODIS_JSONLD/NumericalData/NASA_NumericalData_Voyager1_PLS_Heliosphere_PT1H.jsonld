  "description": "* Data Set Overview\n* =================\n\nVoyager 1 Plasma Data of the Solar Wind, 1 h Averages. The Files in this Directory contain the Voyager hourly average Plasma Data. The Plasma Parameters are obtained by finding the best Fit of a Convected Isotropic Maxwellian Distribution to the Data. One Sigma Errors are typically less than 0.5% in the Speed and the Radial Velocity, VR, less than 5% for the Density and Thermal Speed, and vary greatly for the other two Velocity Components, VT and VN. Sampling Times range from 12 s to 192 s, with sampling generally more frequent early in the Mission. The Columns are:\n\n* 1) Year\n* 2) Day of Year, Day 1 is January 1\n* 3) Hour\n* 4) Proton Speed in km/s, the Magnitude of Velocity Vector\n* 5) Proton Number Density in cm^-3\n* 6) Proton Thermal Speed in km/s, the Proton Temperature in eV is equal to 0.0052 times the Square of the Thermal Speed\n* 7) Velocity Vector R Component, VR, in km/s\n* 8) Velocity Vector T Component, VT, in km/s, Warning: This Parameter is often not reliable after 1989\n* 9) Velocity Vector N Component, VN, in km/s, Warning: This Parameter is often not reliable after 1989\n\nThe Velocity Components are given in the RTN Coordinate System, where R is radially outward, T is in a Plane parallel to the Solar Equatorial Plane and positive in the Direction of Solar Rotation, and N completes the Right-handed System.\n\nPlease consult with us, or at least send Preprints, when you use these Data to prevent grievous Errors or Misconceptions, John Richardson, jdr@space.mit.edu.",
