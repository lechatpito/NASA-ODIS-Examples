  "description": "Magnetic field and electric field data products from the Cluster Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations (STAFF) available from the Cluster Active Archive include: Level 2 calibrated data -- STAFF Waveform Analyzer (STAFF-SC) Complex Spectra of the magnetic field in GSE coordinates (normal mode, up to 12.5 Hz and burst mode up to 225 Hz) with a time resolution of 10 second and a frequency resolution of 0.1 Hz; STAFF-SC Calibrated Magnetic Field WaveForm in ISR2 coordinates (normal mode, 25 Hz sampling and burst mode, 450 Hz sampling); STAFF Spectrum Analyzer (STAFF-SA) Spectral Matrix (8 Hz to 4 KHz) which is the cross-product of the magnetic and electric fileds values computed on-board the spacecraft with time resolutions of 4 seconds and 1 second; and Power Spectral Density (8 Hz to 4 KHz) with time resolutions of 1, 0.125 and 0.25 second.  Level 3 value-added products include STAFF-SA Polarization and Propagation Parameters (8 Hz to 4 KHz).  In the base mode in normal bit rate the auto-spectra are averaged over 1 s, and the complete 25-component matrix is averaged over 4 s for five components. In high bit rate, only the two highest frequency bands are analyzed. In the fast modes, time resolution is 1 s for the cross-spectra, and either 0.125 s or 0.25 s for the auto-spectra.  The physical units for magnetic field spectral power are nT^2 Hz^-1, and electric field spectral power, V^2 m^-2 Hz^-1.  Ancillary data included preliminary spectra, uncalibrated waveform, caveats, and calibration information.  For more details, see \"The Cluster Active Archive: Studying the Earth's Space Plasma Environment\", edited by Dr. Harri Laakso, Matthew G. T. T. Taylor, C. Philippe Escoubet, from which this information was obtained.",
