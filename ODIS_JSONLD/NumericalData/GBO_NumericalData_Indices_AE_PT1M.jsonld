  "description": "AE, AL, AU and AO geomagnetic indices.  \nThe web site of WDC for Geomagnetism at Kyoto U., url given below, \noffers plots and numeric downloads for 1-minute and 1-hour AE and \nrelated indices.  Hourly data are available from July, 1957, through \nnear-current, except for 1976, 1977, and July 1988 through Dec 1989.  \nOne-minute values are available from 1975 forward, with the same \ncoverage gaps as for hourly data.  AL, AU, and AO data start being \navailable in 1966.  The data are currently (as of 12/07/2011) \n\"final\" through June, 1988, and \"provisional\" through September, 2011.  \n\"Real time\" data are available thereafter through another of the \ninterfaces available through the WDC interface given below.  Yet \nanother such interface provides 2.5 min AE values for 1966-1974.  \nAlternative sources of many of the WDC/Kyoto-generated AE and related \nindices include the 1-min and 1-hour OMNI data sets at \nNASA/GSFC/SPDF.",
