  "description": "AMPTE-CCE CHEM data consist of rates and fluxes of ions H through Fe with energies between 3 and 300 keV/q, as functions of mass, mass/charge, energy, and\narrival direction.  Time resolution in the Earth's magnetosphere and magntosheath is less than 1 minute.  Data were originally in VMS binary.  Data are now in daily gzipped FITS files as translated from the original VMS binaries.",
