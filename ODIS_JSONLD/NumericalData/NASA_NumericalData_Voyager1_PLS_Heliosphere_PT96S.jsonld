  "description": "* Data Set Overview\n* =================\n\nVoyager 1 Plasma Data of the Solar Wind, fine resolution Data. The Files in this Directory contain the Voyager fine resolution Plasma Data. The Plasma Parameters are obtained by finding the Best Fit of a convected isotropic Maxwellian Distribution to the Data. One Sigma Errors are typically less than 0.5% in the Speed and in the Radial Velocity Components, VR, less than 5% for the Density and Thermal Speed, and vary greatly for the perpendicular Velocity Components, VT and VN. Sampling Times range from 12 s to 192 s, with sampling generally more frequent early in the Mission. The Columns are:\n\n* 1) Year\n* 2) Day of Year, 1 denotes 1 Jan\n* 3) Decimal Hour\n* 4) Proton Speed in km/s (Magnitude of V)\n* 5) Proton Density in cm^-3\n* 6) Proton Thermal Speed in km/s (Proton Temperature in eV is equal to 0.0052 times the Square of the Thermal Speed)\n* 7) VR\n* 8) VT (Warning: This Parameter is often not reliable after 1989)\n* 9) VN (Warning: This Parameter is often not reliable after 1989)\n\nThe Velocity Components are given in the RTN Coordinate System, where R is radially outward, T is in a Plane parallel to the Solar Equatorial Plane and Positive in the Direction of Solar Rotation, and N completes a right-handed System.\n\nPlease consult with us, or at least send Preprints, when you use these Data to prevent grievous Errors or Misconceptions (John Richardson, jdr@space.mit.edu).",
