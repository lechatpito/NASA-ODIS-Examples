  "description": "There are several data products from the \nYohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) that are accessible through \nthe Yohkoh Legacy Archive (YLA) at Montana State University.  \nDigital data include Level 0 data, Level 1 Full Frame (whole \ndisk) Images (FFI) and Partial Frame Images (PFI) in both FITS \nand XDA formats, Level 2 SXT Scientific Composites (SSC - \nwhole disk images) in FITS and XDA, plus corresponding arrays \nof uncertainties due to statistics and decompression, and \nLevel 3 images in FITS and XDA.  XDA is a Yohkoh-specific \nstandard format under Solar-Soft.  L1 and L2 data are fully \ncorrected and calibrated; time spacing between FFI images is \nabout 128 sec or longer.  L3 images are optimized for viewing \nas a movie rather than quantitative analysis.  Display data \ninclude one movie-quality image perday, taken near mid-day, \nand weekly movies built from 12 images per day.",
