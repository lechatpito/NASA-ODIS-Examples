  "description": "This data set contains ultraviolet images in quasi-logarithmically compressed counts from the vacuum ultraviolet imaging photometer of the Spin-Scan Auroral Imager (SAI) flown on DE 1. The time resolution was 3 to 12 minutes per image. Also included are the GCI position vector, velocity vector and spin axis of the spacecraft. Data are available in CDF format from CDAWeb.",
