  "description": "This data set contains the low rate data from the C/NOFS Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI) lightning detector during nighttime passes of the satellite along its low inclination (13 degree) orbit and within the altitude domain defined by the satellite's perigee and apogee of 401 km and 867 km, respectively. Two photodiodes measure white light irradiance at 2 Hz in 7 threshold values and in 2 look directions (north and south). Data are at 0.5-sec resolution. The lightning detector data may be used to identify a possible relationship between the occurrence of lightning and the occurrence of Spread-F caused, deep density dropouts in the ionosphere.
