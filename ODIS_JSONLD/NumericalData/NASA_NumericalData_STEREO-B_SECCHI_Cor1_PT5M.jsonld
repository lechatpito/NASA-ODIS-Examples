  "description": "The COR1 telescope is the inner coronagraph of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instrument suite aboard the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. Like all coronagraphs, COR1 is designed to measure the weak light from the solar corona in the presence of scattered light from the much brighter solar photosphere. It designed to observe the white light corona from 1.4 to 4 solar radii.",
