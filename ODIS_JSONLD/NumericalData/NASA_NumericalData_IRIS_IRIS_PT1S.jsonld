  "description": "This data set contains calibrated level-2 images and spectra data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). \n\nUV images from IRIS telescope record observations of features as small\nas 240 km (150 miles) on the sun every five to ten seconds at specific\ntemperatures, ranging from 5,000 K to 120,000 K (and up to 10 million\nK during solar flares). This range allows observations of material\nmoving between the surface of the sun, called the photosphere, and in\nthe lowermost layers of the atmosphere, called the chromosphere and\ntransition region.\n\nSpectra are obtained every two to thirty seconds along a slit (1/3\narcsec wide) of solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10\nmillion K, providing information on exactly how much light is visible\nfrom any specific wavelength.  This corresponds to how much material\nis present at specific velociites, temperatures and densities.\n\nThe level-2 data is corrected for dark current, flat-field, and\ngeometric deformation, scaled to the same plate-scale, and packaged\ninto timeseries of slitjaw images and spectral raster scans.\n      ",
