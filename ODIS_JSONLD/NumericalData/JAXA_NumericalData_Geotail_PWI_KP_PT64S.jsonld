  "description": "This set of key paraments from the Geotail Plasma Wave Instrument includes: Peak and average electric and magnetic spectra from the multichannel analyzer MCA (at 5 frequencies from 5.6 Hz to 311 kHz for the electric antenna and at 4 frequencies from 5.6 Hz to 10 kHz for the magnetic coils); Peak and average spectra intentsities (scala only) averaged over 64 seconds from the Sweep Frequency Analyzer SFA (24 Hz to 800 kHz); Frequency corresponding to the peak of the spectral intensities (scalar only); and spacecraft position in GSE cartesian coordinates.
