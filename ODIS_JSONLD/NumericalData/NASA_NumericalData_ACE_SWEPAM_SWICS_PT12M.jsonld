  "description": "These data files contain 12-min resolution solar wind\nproton flow velocity (GSE, RTN and GSM components), scalar speed, density, \nand (radial component of) temperature, plus the alpha particle to proton \ndensity ratio.  The data are typically from the SWEPAM instrument.  But \nbecause SWEPAM has reduced sensitivity at the lowest energies, and at \ntimes underestimates the proton density, especially for very slow wind, \nproton density is sometimes culled from low-speed (.LT. ~350 km/s) \nintervals in the SWEPAM Level 2 data, and proton temperature may also \nbe culled. More rarely, the solar wind velocity may also be culled, \nespecially during periods of both high solar energetic particle \nbackground and high wind speeds.  In these cases, SWICS-determined \nproton density and temperature, and possibly also flow speed (not \nvelocity vectors), are included in the data records, with a flag to\nindicate whether, and which, SWICS parameters are in the records.\nAs of July, 2012, data were available to the end of 2009.",
