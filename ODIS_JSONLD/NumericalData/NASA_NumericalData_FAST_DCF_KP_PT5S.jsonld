  "description": "This data set provides the 5-second (spin-averaged) FAST survey electric and magnetic field (Delta B) data within the low altitude auroral arc region. The three-axis searchcoil magnetometer (the AC magnetometer) provides measurement of structures and waves corresponding to ELF and VLF frequencies.  Magnetic field power spectral densities are obtained between 10 Hz and 4 kHz on two axes, and from the third one that is sampled up to 2 MHz, the magnetic component of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR).  Once the auroral electron precipitation is detected, survey data will shift from a slow to a fast survey mode at rates of 32 to 2048 samples per second.  Slow survey data has ~0.06 s resolution, and fast survey, typically has ~0.5 ms resolution. There is a frequency-dependent sensitivity between 10^-8 and 10^-10 nT^2/Hz. Electric field power spectral densities are also provided for the same frequency ranges.\n",
