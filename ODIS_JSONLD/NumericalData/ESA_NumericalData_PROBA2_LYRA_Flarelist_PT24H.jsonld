  "description": "This dataset contains daily lists of solar flares observed by the Large Yield RAdiometer (LYRA) onboard Proba 2. The lists recorded the begin, peak, and end time of each flare (1-minute averages), its class of intensity, and the region. The purpose of the list is to get an overview of the flares that LYRA observes and relate them to class, begin, max, etc. according to GOES. Besides listing the values in ASCII format, each file also provides a plot.",
