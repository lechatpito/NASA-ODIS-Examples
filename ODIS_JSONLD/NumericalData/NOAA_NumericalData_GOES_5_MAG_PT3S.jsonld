The file names indicates the data type, spacecraft number, year, month, and resolution. For example, M0137607.FIT indicates magnetometer data (M) for spacecraft 1 (01) at 3 s time resolution (3) from July 1976 (7607). Note that spacecraft IDs 91 and 92 refer to SMS satellites, not GOES."

  "description": "The spinning twin fluxgate magnetometer, located at a few meters away from the spacecraft was designed to provide the orthogonal components of the magnetic field: Hp was parallel to the spin axis that was held nearly parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth, He was directed toward Earth center, and Hn pointed eastward. The magnetometer had a range of \u00b1400 nT (without saturation) and a resolution of 0.1 nT over a range of \u00b150 nT. The sensitivity of the magnetometer was about 0.2 nT. The instrument and its electronics were carried on board GOES 4, GOES 5, GOES 6, and GOES 7, without significant changes. Data during the first 3 months of 1986 has poor quality Hp component. The experiment became inoperational in February, 1987.",
