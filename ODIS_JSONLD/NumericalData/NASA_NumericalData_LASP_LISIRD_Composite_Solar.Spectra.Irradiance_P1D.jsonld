  "description": "This data product contains daily-averaged solar \nspectra over the UV range 120-400 nm in 1 nm bins from multiple \nspacecraft, including SME, Nimbus 7 SBUV, NOAA 9 and 11 SBUV/2, UARS \nSUSIM and UARS SOLSTICE.  Data are available from 1978-Nov-08 to \n2005-Aug-01.  Data include irradiances and their absolute and long-term\nuncertainties.  Data are available both as a zipped text data file \nand as an IDL save file via LISIRD at LASP.  The data set was created\nby Matthew DeLand of SSAI.",
