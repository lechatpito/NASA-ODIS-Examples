  "description": "This San Marco D/L Electric Field Experiment (EFI) data set was provided \nby the PI team on 12 magnetic tapes in ASCII format and constitutes the \nfinal EFI archiving product (filename: yymmddhhmm.dc). The data from the\nfirst tape are available online in this directory. The following parameters \nhave been archived: (A) DC electric field (8 points per second) along \nthe X and Y axes in spacecraft coordinates; (B) Variational (AC) electric \nfields averaged at 0.5 second intervals for all channels of each of the \nthree spectrometers; (C) Some orbital parameters such as the altitude of \nthe satellite, the geographic longitude and latitude, the local solar \ntime and the dip latitude, and a day/night flag for the DC data; (D) Non-\nreduced plasma ion densities measured by the Ion Velocity Instrument \n(IVI). The DC portion of the EFI experiment is only valid for non-reduced \nIVI data > 2.5 volts corresponding roughly to an electron density of 10^4 \nelectrons per cubic centimeter. Note that the AC data is valid at all \nplasma densities. More details can be found in the acformat_sfdu.txt and the \nvoldesc_sfdu.txt files. Both of these files are ASCII text files.\n\nFurther details about the San Marco spacecraft, experiment, and data sets \ncan be found at the San Marco home page, http://crpsm.psm.uniroma1.it/ \n ",
