  "description": "This dataset consists of spectrograms in Right and Left Circular Polarization from 16-32 MHz. These observations were made at the AJ4CO Observatory using a Terminated Folded Dipole (TFD) Array and a Dual Polarization Spectrograph system. The system provides simultaneous correlated Right Circularly Polarized (RCP) and Left Circularly Polarized (LCP) data. These data are generated using the Radio-Sky Spectrograph Software.\n\nThese data may include observations of Solar Radio Bursts, Jupiter decametric radio emission, or Galactic Background radio emission.\n\nThe Radio-SkyPipe produced datafiles consist of a fixed length header and a variable length note. The data portion of the file for one channel of data consists of an 8 byte timestamp using the VisualBasic 6 date format (days since 1 Jan 1900) followed by one 8 byte data value (Channel 1), this pattern repeats until the end of file. More details on the format of Radio-Sky Spectrograph datafiles can be found in the Data File Structure document on the Radio-SkyPipe help page (see Information URL).",
