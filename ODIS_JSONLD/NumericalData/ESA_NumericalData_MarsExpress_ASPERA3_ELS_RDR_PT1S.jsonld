  "description": "The data consist of fluxes of electrons at several tens (time-\nvariable number) of energy steps in the 0.01-20keV energy range, in 16 look directions. \nThe data are organized in csv ASCII format for spreadsheet usage.  Any given\nspreadsheet may have hours of ~1-sec distributions from the low energy range or\nhigh energy range.  Deflection voltages used, between 1.31 and 21 V or between 21\nand 2800 V are given in the data arrays, with conversion factors to transform to\nparticle energy being given in documentation files.  No spacecraft trajectory\ndata are included in these Level 2, reduced data records but see\nhttps://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA&page=ancillary.  As of June 2012, these data were available for mid-2003 through Jun 2011, although for the 2003 cruise phase, a total of only several hours of data were generated and are available.",
