  "description": " This data set was generated at NSSDC by making one-hour averages of the ISEE 3 Solar Wind Electron Moments in 168 second resolution. There were no time shifts used in creating these hourly averages. Each data file contains data for one year. Data coverage runs from 1982/02/01 through 1992/06/13. There is a data gap from 16 October 1982 to 23 December 1983, corresponding to the geotail phase of the mission. Data parameters (hourly averages) are: electron density, bulk flow speed, bulk flow azimuth, minimum total temperature (Tper), maximum total temperature (Tpar), azimuth of maximum temperature, heat flux, and the heat flux azimuth.\n\nThere is no spacecraft position information in this data set. The normalized 1-hr data set, however, does include the spacecraft position.\n\nHourly ephemeris data are available online for the time period from soon after launch through the end of the primary mission, i.e., from August 13, 1978 through February 7, 1987. See the data set \"isee3_dp_ephem.asc\" and its description \"aareadme_isee3_dp_ephem\" in the directory at ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/isee/isee3/traj/hourly_magnetospheric.\n\nThere is also a trajectory data set with one point per day for the ICE phase of the mission: 1984 - 1997. Its documentation can be found at ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/isee/isee3/traj/daily/icetrjdy_fmt.txt and the data set itself is at ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/isee/isee3/traj/daily/icetrja.asc.
