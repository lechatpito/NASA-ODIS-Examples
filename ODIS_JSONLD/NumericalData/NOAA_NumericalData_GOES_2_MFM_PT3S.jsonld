The file names indicates the data type, spacecraft number, year, month, and resolution. For example, M0137607.FIT indicates magnetometer data (M) for spacecraft 1 (01) at 3 s time resolution (3) from July 1976 (7607). Note that spacecraft IDs 91 and 92 refer to SMS satellites, not GOES."

  "description": "A biaxial, closed loop, fluxgate magnetometer was deployed on a boom about 0.61 m long. The magnetometer, which had one sensor aligned parallel to the spacecraft spin axis and the other perpendicular to this axis, measured the magnetic field at synchronous altitude. Each sensor had a selectable range (+50, 100, 200, or 400 nT), an offset field capability (plus or minus 1200 nT in 40 nT steps), and an inflight calibration capability.",
