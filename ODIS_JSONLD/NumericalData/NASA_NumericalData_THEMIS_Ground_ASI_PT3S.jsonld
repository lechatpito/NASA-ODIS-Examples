  "description": "This data set at the THEMIS Mission Data website at University of California, Berkeley contains full resolution Level-0 Ground All Sky Images of the white light aurora for all observatories in North America.  The ASI stations each monitor a 170 degree field of view imaging the auroral oval at kilometer resolution.  The ASI is comprised of a fisheye lens and CCD in a stainless steel enclosure topped with a transparent acrylic dome.  Exposure control ranges from 5 s to 1 ms although the typical data rate is one image every 3 seconds.  Silicone heaters keep the instrument within the nominal temperature range.  During daylight hours a sun shades deploy to protect the CCD.",
