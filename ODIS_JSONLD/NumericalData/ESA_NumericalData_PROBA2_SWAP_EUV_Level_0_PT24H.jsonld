  "description": " This Proba 2 SWAP (Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing) dataset contains level 0 raw data of the solar corona.  Images are sampled near 17.4 nm every minute by the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) imager, showing how the sun's corona changes and evolves over time. Each LV0 FITS file contains an image in digital numbers (DN) and all the information that is required to analyze it, but at the same time it restricts this information to that subset which is stable over time and will not require reprocessing when a new understanding of the instrument performance becomes available.",
