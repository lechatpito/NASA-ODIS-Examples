  "description": "This data set was generated at NSSDC by selecting data parameters from the ISEE 3 data pool tape (binary) and converting to ASCII. The time resolution is about an hour and 4 minutes. Data records that contained fill data for the spacecraft position were not included in this data set. Only data items that are not instrument-specific are included here. The data items, in order, are: year, day of year (Jan. 1 = 001), seconds of day, bit rate code, maneuver code, spin period average (in seconds) over the hour, and the GSE X,Y,Z components of the spacecraft position (in km). The bit rate code is 1,2, or 4\nfor bit rates of 512, 1024, or 4028 bps, respectively. The maneuver code is 0 if there were no maneuvers during that time period (which can be up to an hour\nand four minutes starting at the given time), and is 7 if there were any maneuvers during that time. Record length is 78 bytes. The time period covered\nis from soon after launch through the end of the primary mission, i.e., August 13, 1978 through February 7, 1987.  ",
