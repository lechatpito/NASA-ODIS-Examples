  "description": "RadioJOVE Multiple Frequency Data Product. This data set consists of observations made at the Hawk's Nest Radio Astronomy Observatory (HNRAO) using a Long Wavelength Array (LWA) 4 phased crossed dipoles square array and an FSX-2 10 bit single polarization spectrograph. These data are generated using the Radio Sky Spectrograph software. The data set consists of 1 channel of data. All submitted data appear to identify this channel as RCP but the polarization is selectable as either RCP or LCP.\n\nThese data may include observations of Solar Radio Bursts, Jupiter decametric radio emission, or Galactic Background radio emission.\n\nThe Radio-Sky Spectrograph produced datafiles consist of a fixed length header and a variable length note. The data portion of the file for two channel data consists of an 8 byte timestamp using the VisualBasic 6 date format (days since 1 Jan 1900) followed by two 8 byte data values (Channel 1 followed by Channel 2), this pattern repeats until the end of file. More details can be found in the Data File Structure document on the Radio-SkyPipe help page (see Information URL).\n\nThese data are submitted to the RadioJOVE Archive and to the PDS/PPI archive at UCLA.",
