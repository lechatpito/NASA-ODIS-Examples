  "description": "\n               This data set contains hour averages of the interplanetary magnetic     \n               field (IMF) measurements obtained by the triaxial fluxgate magnetometer \n               experiment on Voyager 1. Identical instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 were  \n               designed to measure the IMF between  Earth and Saturn (10 AU) during the \n               primary Voyager mission. The  design and performance yielded absolute   \n               accuracies to better than < 0.1 nT. In general, each component of the   \n               hourly average has an uncertainty of up  to (+/- 0.05 nT) in the region \n               beyond 10 AU. More accurate measurements can be  obtained by special    \n               processing of the data, but it was not feasible to do this for the      \n               entire data set included here.
