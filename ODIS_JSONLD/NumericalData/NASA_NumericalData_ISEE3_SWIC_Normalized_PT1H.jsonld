  "description": "This data set contains ISEE 3 electron moments in the solar wind, normalized and in 1-hour resolution, from the LANL Solar Wind Plasma experiment. The data are electron-based and have been corrected and normalized to existing ion data.  Each logical record contains the date (YYMMDD), the universal time (HRMIN), the spacecraft position in GSE coordinates in earth radii, the electron density (1/cm**3) normalized to the ion data, for dates 780816 - 821016, the bulk speed (km/s), and the electron temperature (K). Although the bulk parameters given are reliable, standard errors associated with them are higher for electrons than for ions. A few \"bad\" points remain on the tape. Densities less than .01/cm**3 and velocities less than 100 km/s should be considered erroneous. Each file contains data for a whole year.\n",
