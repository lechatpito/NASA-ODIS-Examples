  "description": "This set of data came from the Injun 5 Very Low Frequency experiment that covered the frequency range from dc to 105 kHz for electric fields and from 30 Hz to 10 kHz for magnetic fields. Magnitudes of naturally occurring magnetospheric electric fields were measured to an accuracy of \u00b1 30 mv/m.  Each record covers ten milliseconds of data. ",
