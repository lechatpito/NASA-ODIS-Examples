  "description": "This trajectory data set is provided by NSSDC.  NSSDC has been actively supporting the Ulysses mission from the start by providing up-to-date trajectory-related data and graphics to the investigator community and the cognizant NASA Headquarters personnel. Soon after the launch, NSSDC generated (and later updated after Jupiter encounter) and loaded online for public access a list file of daily coordinates for Ulysses, along with software to manipulate these Cartesian coordinates into other sets, notably the heliographic latitude/longitude/radial distance. Similar online files of all other heliospheric spacecraft enable computations of their relative locations. The NSSDC Report 91-08, \"Trajectories of Inner and Outer Heliospheric Spacecraft,\" has been requested often. (Higher resolution data may be obtained by executing the online code in DECnet: RUN NSSDCA::ANON_DIR:[ACTIVE.HELIO]HELICOOR.",
