  "description": "This dataset is of the Hawkeye Spacecraft LEPEDEA ion moments made over the entire mission. Ion moments, treated as 100% protons, are derived from LEPEDEA ramp measurements, one ramp energy sweep takes 1.44 s, time between ion sweeps is 11.52s, spin period is about 11s, so about 21 sweeps are required for uniform coverage in the spin plane. The FOV is 8 degrees (spin-plane) x 30 degrees (out of spin pane), so the FOV covered over a spin is about pi of 4*pi steradians. The time step between moment computations varies between 70 and 110s and the time interval for a moment computation was typically 21x2 sweeps or 484s,so moment computation intervals overlapped. LEPEDEA is not a solar wind instrument. No correction for the external photo-electron sheath has been made, the impact is estimated to be small.\r\n         ",
