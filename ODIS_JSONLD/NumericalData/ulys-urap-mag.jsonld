  "description": "The B magnitude measurements are given in nanoTesla and are obtained by the detection of power spectrum relative minima at the harmonics of the gyrofrequency (firstly published in Meyer et al., J. Geophys. Res., 98, 21163-21176,1993 and references therein) . The given acquisition time is the elapsed time (UT) of the sweeping receiver at the highest harmonic acquisition. ",
