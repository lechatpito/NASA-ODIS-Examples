  "description": "SEE Level 3 data files contain one daily averaged solar irradiance spectrum in 1 nm intervals extracted from the EGS Level 2 and XPS Level 2 data products. Shortward of 27 nm, a solar model is scaled to match the XPS broadband data. SEE Level 3 data files also contain 38 emission lines extracted from EGS Level 2 spectra, and the XPS Level 2 diode irradiances.\n\nFor normal operations, SEE observes the Sun for about 3 minutes every orbit (97 minutes), which usually gives 14-15 measurements per day. The SEE Level 3 data are time averaged over the entire day, after applying corrections for atmospheric absorption, degradation, flare removal, and to 1-AU.",
