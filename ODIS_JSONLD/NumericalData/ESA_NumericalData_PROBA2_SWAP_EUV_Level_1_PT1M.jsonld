  "description": " This dataset contains level 1 calibrated images from the Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing (SWAP) onboard Proba 2.  Images of the solar corona are sampled near 17.4 nm every minute by the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) imager and corrected for all known instrumental defects, with the image data in exposure-normalized units (DN/s/pixel). The resulting FITS file is the reference science product that does not require the user to use any proprietary software.",
