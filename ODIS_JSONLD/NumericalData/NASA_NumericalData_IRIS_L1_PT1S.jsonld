  "description": "This data set contains Level 1 images and spectra from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).\n\nRIRIS records spectra in the near-ultraviolet band (NUV) from 278.3 nm to 283.4 nm and in the far-ultraviolet bands from 133.2 nm to 135.8 nm (FUV 1) and 138.9 nm to 140.7 nm (FUV 2). The spectra are obtained every 0.5 s to 60 s along a slit (1/3\" wide). IRIS detects solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K. IRIS slit-jaw images (SJI) are taken every 0.5 s to 60 s using filters centered at Mg II k 279.6 nm (SJI 2796), the far Mg II h wing at 283.2 nm (SJI 2832), C II at 133 nm (SJI 1330), and Si IV at 140 nm (SJI 1400). In this way, IRIS provides images of solar features as small as 240 km (150 miles) and allows inference of how much material is present at specific velocities, temperatures and densities. These data can then be used to probe the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the transition region and thus to study energetic and dynamic properties of material throughout the solar atmosphere.\n\nThe Level 1 data are derived from Level 0 files and is used to create the Standard Science Product (science-ready Level 2 data). The Level 1 data is identical to level 0 data except that it is rotated and flipped so that north is up in the images and the wavelength and x coordinate increase to right. This data level product consists of series for FUV1, FUV2, and NUV spectral data, and slit-jaw images with appropriate Level 1 keywords.",
