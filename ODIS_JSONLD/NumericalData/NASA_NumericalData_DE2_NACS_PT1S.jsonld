  "description": "This data set containss, at 1-sec resolution, the neutral temperature and the densities (and % error) of O, N2, He, N, and Ar from the Neutral Atmosphere Composition Spectrometer (NACS) flown on DE 2. Composition data are most reliable at altitudes less than 500 km. Data are available in ASCII from nssdcftp and in CDF format from CDAWeb (as well as CDAWeb plots and lists).",
