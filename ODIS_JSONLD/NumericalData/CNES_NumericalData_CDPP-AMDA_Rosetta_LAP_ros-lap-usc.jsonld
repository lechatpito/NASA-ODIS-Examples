  "description": "For most science purposes, the most useful s/c potential estimate is the U_SC data product \n            which is available at 32 to 160 second resolution and covers \n            most of the mission. \n            \n            Depending on instrument operational mode, this is taken either from the  \n            average over 32 s of measured voltage of a sunlit LAP probe (preferably LAP1) floating with \n            no bias current or voltage applied, sometimes known as Vfloat, or by the equivalent estimate from Langmuir  \n            probe bias sweeps, which the voltage Vz at which the current to the probe is \n            zero. We expect U_SC to  differ from the true spacecraft potential \n            by a small offset (due to the potential over the probe sheath, of order one volt) and a factor \n            (typically 75-80%) due to some part of the potential field from the spacecraft remaining at the \n            probe position.\n            \n            A parameter DATA_SOURCE indicates which of these methods have been \n            used for every single sweep.\n            \nThis is a preliminary data set which will be replaced by another in a few months.            \n            ",
