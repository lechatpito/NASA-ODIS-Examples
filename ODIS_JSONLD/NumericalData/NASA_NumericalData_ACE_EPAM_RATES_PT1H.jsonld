  "description": "This descriptor identifies an ensemble of 8 data sets of EPAM count rates averaged over 1-hour intervals in each of several energy bins. One data set (PG65) has spin-averaged rates while the other 7 have rates in each of 4 or 8 spin sectors. Each of the 7 sectored data sets is specific to a given one of the several EPAM instruments (apertures). Each of the 8 data sets is individually described in the VHO/VEPO interface at https://vho.gsfc.nasa.gov.",
