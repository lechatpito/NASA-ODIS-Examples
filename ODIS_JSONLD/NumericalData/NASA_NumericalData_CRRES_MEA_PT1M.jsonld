  "description": "This data set holds 1-min resolution electron distributions from the Medium Electron Sensor/Analyzer (MEA) on the CRRES spacecraft. The data consists of counting rates from 17 energy channels in the range of 0.1-2 MeV and 19 pitch angle bins at 1 minute time intervals. The average flux, 90 degree flux and N value are included. Also included are the spacecraft geographic coordinates and altitude, L shell, and the local and equatorial magnetic field magnitudes from the 1977 Olson-Pfitzer model of the earth's geomagnetic field. The raw high resolution (0.512 sec) data and documentation of raw data can be obtained via ftp from NSSDC.",
