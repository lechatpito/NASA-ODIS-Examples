  "description": "This data set contains energy spectra of electrons from the 2nd telescope (2E) of the DOK-2 instrument on board the Interball-Tail spacecraft.\n\nThis data set contains energy spectra of ions from the 2nd telescope (2P) of the DOK-2 instrument on board the Interball-Tail spacecraft.\n\nMost of the  time, the  2E detector was directed at 62\u00b0 to the satellite spin axis. Energy spectra of electrons were measured at 55 channels in the range 27 to 400 keV. Selected 55 energy channels are identified by numbers (1 - 55).",
