  "description": "12-day plots of IMP-8 Electrostatic Energy-Charge Analyzer, EECA, energetic particle fluxes with data the P3, P5, P7 and A2 detectors. Each plot covers one orbit, and each is color-coded to show the nominal positions of the bow shock and the magnetopause. Data from EECA at selected rates are are also available. The access portal is hosted by the University of Maryland and some text from the portal web page has been paraphrased here.",
