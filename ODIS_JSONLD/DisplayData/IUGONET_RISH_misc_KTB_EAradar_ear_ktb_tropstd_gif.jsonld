  "description": "The time-height plots of the three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds), the echo power and spectral width of five radar beams in the troposphere and lower stratosphere between 2 and 20 km. The observation data have been taken by the equatorial atmosphere radar (EAR) at Kototabang, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL), which has been operated in the standard observation mode of the troposphere and stratosphere. The data are stored in the gif file named (year)(month).(variable).gif for one month plot or (year)(month)(day).(variable).gif for one day plot. The variable abbreviations are wnd, pwr and wdt, which mean wind velocity, echo power and spectral width, respectively. Local time is used for time. The right panels of each time-height plot are 1-day or 1-month average profiles of each parameter as a function of height. The missing data are presented by white color.",
