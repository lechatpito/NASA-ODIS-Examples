  "description": "The two-dimensional plot of rain cloud distribution estimated from the X-band weather radar at Kototabang in West Sumatra, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL), which has been operated since September 23, 2002. This plot shows a spatial distribution of reflective energy flux from rain clouds at 2.1 km height within a 30 km circular region at the center of radar location. The unit of reflective energy flux is dBZ. File names are composed of (year)(month)(day).(hour)(minute)(second).gif. Local time (UT + 7h) is used for time data.",
