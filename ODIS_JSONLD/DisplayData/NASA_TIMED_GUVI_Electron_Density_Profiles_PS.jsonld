  "description": "F region electron density as a function of altitude and latitude derived from the GUVI limb data. Summaries of estimated peak electron density and total electron content are also given.  The profiles are derived from the 135.6 nm channel of the GUVI limb data. The 135.6 nm emission at night is due almost exclusively to recombination of O+ ions. Since O+ is the primary ion in the F region, the 135.6 nm volume emission rate is closely related to the square of the electron density.  The file spans roughly 63 days in one-day plots",
