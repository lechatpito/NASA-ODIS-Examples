  "description": "This movie illustrates the development of the vertical component of magnetic field in the neutral surface. At the \n\t  start of the movie, the field is everywhere quite weak, even in the flow channels. By 04:11 UT, the fast flow compresses the \n\t  magnetic field ahead of it turning a narrow region to reddish brown. Similar compression appears at 04:32 UT as the extended \n\t  narrow flow channel begins to form. Shortly later, the region encompassing the THEMIS orbits begins to turn continuously red \n\t  indicating the accumulation of magnetic flux in the region. By 04:44 UT, the single flow channel continues to deliver magnetic \n\t  flux to this region. As shown in the text, this is the time identified as expansion onset when tail field rotates to a more \n\t  dipolar configuration. Contours of Vx = 250 km/s are denoted by heavy black lines. Heavy black and white lines at >10 Re \n\t  pre-midnight depict the location of THEMIS spacecraft. A dashed black semi-circle defines synchronous orbit. White lines are \n\t  contours of plasma pressure. The Earth is a green half-circular patch.",
