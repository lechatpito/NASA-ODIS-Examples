  "description": "This data set consists of images of thermospheric\nO/N2 column density ratios at 2-min resolution during times of strong\ngeomagnetic storms (Dst.LT.-80nT) of 2000-2005. The ratios are generated\nfrom dayside airglow observations of the IMAGE Far Ultraviolet (FUV)\nSpectrographic Imager (SI).  The SI has a peak response at the OI 135.6 nm\noxygen emission line and a bandpass of 131.0 to 140.0 nm which includes\nthe LBH band from N2 molecules. For each O/N2 plot, there is a plot of the\nSI image from which the O/N2 plot was generated, and there is an IDL saveset\nof the content of the O/N2 maps.  The Information URL of this descriptor\nidentifies detailed discussions of the derivations of O/N2 rations from the\nSI images.",
