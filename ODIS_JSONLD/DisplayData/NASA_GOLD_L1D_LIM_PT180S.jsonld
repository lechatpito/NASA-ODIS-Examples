  "description": "Level 1D files contain a thumbnail image (PNG) for individual limb scans. There is also a combined thumbnail \n   image file created that contains 4 images: 1356 Angstrom (Atomic Oxygen), total Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH), stack of 8 \n   slices for different latitudes of brightness as a function of wavelength and tangent altitude, and a single line plot with \n   brightness of 1356, LBH Short (denoted LBH1), and LBH Long (denoted LBH2) as a function of tangent altitude. Separate files \n   are created for Channel A and Channel B data. A new L1D file is generated for each new L1C file. These can correspond to either \n   the Northern or Southern hemisphere.",
