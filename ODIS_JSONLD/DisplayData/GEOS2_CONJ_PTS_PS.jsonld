  "description": "This  dataset contains an Earth map where is superimposed the footprint of the magnetic field line crossing the GEOS spacecraft. The two positions on the Earth (North and South) of the field line are called \u00ab conjugated points \u00bb . The North one is useful for using the ground based measurement in coordination with GEOS, located in Scandinavia at Husafell, Kitdalen and Skibotn.\nGeocentric distance, and magnetic L parameter, are also plotted.\nThe magnetic field model is Tsyganenko 1989, with corresponding Kp indices, also given.",
