  "description": "The time-height plots of the three components of wind velocity (zonal, meridional and vertical winds), the Doppler velocity, echo power and spectral width of five radar beams in the mesosphere between 60 and 100 km taken by the MU radar at Shigaraki in Shiga Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL), which has been operated in the standard observation mode of the mesosphere. File name of each plot is composed of (year)(month)(day).(variable)_org.png (original data) and (year)(month)(day).(variable)_scr.png (screening data). The variable abbreviations are wnd, dpl, pwr and wdt, which mean wind velocity, radial Doppler velocity, echo power and spectral width, respectively. The azimuth and zenith angles of beam 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are (0, 0), (0, 10), (90, 10), (180, 10) and (270, 10), respectively, in unit of degree. The plots of all observation parameters are made using the netCDF data, and for the plots of the screening data, the data with condition code of less than 4 are used. On the other hand, for the plots of wind data, only the data with flag 0 are used. Please refer to README (http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mu/mesosphere/note/README_mur_mesosphere_data.html and http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mu/mesosphere/note/README_mur_mesosphere_wind_data.html) about detailed description of condition code and flag. Local time (UT + 09:00) is used for time data.",
