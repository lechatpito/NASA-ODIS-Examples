  "description": "This dataset contains dynamic spectrogram PNG plots of the ISEE1/PWI Sweep Frequency Receiver (SFR) data. Each plot spans one day. These data were obtained from the Ev long wire antenna in the spin plane and the Eu two-sphere antenna via the SFR receiver. The title above each spectrogram is \"ISEE-1 PWI Sweep Frequency Receiver Ev and Eu Antennas\" Each spectrogram is a plot of the power spectral density of received signal (color scale) as a function of operating frequency (in a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Beneath the time labels on the horizontal axis of the spectrograms are ephemeris data: position of the spacecraft in radial distance (Earth radii), geomagnetic latitude, magnetic local time, and McIlwain L-shell. Overlaid on each image are traces of the electron cyclotron frequencies. Located in the same directory are are the 12 hour ISEE-1 PWI Spectrum Analyzer (SA) spectrograms.",
