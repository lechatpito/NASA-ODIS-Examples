  "description": "This data set contains GEOS-2 3D Positions in GSE system.\n\n This is a projection of the GEOS-2 orbit on the 3 planes of Geocentric Solar Equatorial system (GSE), i.e. X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes. A 3-D perspective view is also added.\n\nMeasured positions, given from auxiliary data, are plotted in blue, while corresponding estimated Kepler ellipse is plotted in green. The estimated Kepler parameters are computed from a fit with the experimental positions and a model. So, the values of apogee, perigee, semi-major and semi-minor axis could differ a little bit from one view to another one.\n\nTime ticks are used to locate the spacecraft at a given time.",
