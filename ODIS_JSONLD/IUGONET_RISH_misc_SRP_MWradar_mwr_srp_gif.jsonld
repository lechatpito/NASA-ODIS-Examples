  "description": "The time-height plot of horizontal wind data in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (70-112 km) estimated from the meteor wind radar at Serpong, one of the south-west suburbs of Jakarta, Indonesia (6.36S, 106.65E, 50 m MSL). File names are composed of date and variable abbreviation: jkt(year)(month)(day).(resolution).gif (daily plot), jkt(year)(month).(resolution).gif (monthly plot) and jkt(year).(resolution).gif (yearly plot). The resolution abbreviations are h2t60min00 and h4t240min00 (please refer to the metadata of text or netCDF data for details of the resolution abbreviations). These plots are made using the netCDF data of each resolution in time and height. For yearly plot, only the h2t60min00 and h4t60min00 data are used and averaged for each day. The daily average is done if there are more than one valid data in all of the three time zones (0-4, 8-12 and 16-20 h).",
