  "description": "This is the database of cosmic ray intensity obtained by the Multi-Directional Cosmic-Ray Muon Telescope at Nagoya. This telescope was constructed as a part of Japanese program for the International Active Sun Year (IASY) and started continuous observation of the cosmic-ray intensities in October 1970. This telescope has an effective area of 36 m^2 x 2 stages. The height of the observatory is 77 m above sea level. For details of the data, please take a look at http://www.stelab.nagoya-u.ac.jp/ste-www1/div3/muon/dbtext22.pdf. In this meta-database, we chose particle as proton due to restriction of the current SPASE format. However, the actual measurement is done for muon. The primary cosmic ray intensity and energy range recorded in this meta data was inferred from the muon measurement on the ground.",
