  "description": "These WHISPER daily dynamic spectrograms from each of the four Cluster spacecraft are plots of the received signal (the color scale indicates the voltage spectral density as Vrms Hz^-1/2) as a function of receiver frequency (on vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). At the top of the image is the name of the instrument and date and above each plot the overflow status is indicated by a color code. Each spectrogram spans a frequency range from 2 through 80 kHz. Beneath the time labels on the horizontal axis are ephemeris data: position of the spacecraft in radial distance (Earth radii), latitude, and local time (GSE coordinates). The plots include data when the instruments are operating in both passive and active mode.",
