  "description": "Amplitude and phase time series of low frequency standard radio transmitter signals at 22.10, 37.50, 60.00, and 77.50kHz received at the Rabben station (Ny-Alseund, Norway) of Natinal Institude of Polar Research (NIPR). Variations in the phase and amplitude reflect changes of the ionization state in the lower ionosphere which is caused by energetic electron precipitation from inner magnetosphere (radiation belt), solar x-rays, lightning dischanges, and so on.",
