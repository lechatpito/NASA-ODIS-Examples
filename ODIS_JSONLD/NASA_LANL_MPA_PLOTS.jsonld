  "description": "Daily plots in three formats of geosynchronous MPA (Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer) data for each relevant LANL spacecraft (7 as of 2006), separately for ions and electrons. Two spectral plots show color coded fluxes vs. time, (a) vs. energy in four 90 deg spin phase bins and (b) vs. spin phase in four energy bins. The third plot type shows many moments vs. time, including ion and electron densities, parallel and perpendicular temperatures, and distribution function symmetry axis directions.",
