  "description": "The movie shows the GSM Y component of the electric field calculated from the cross product of vectors V and B on \n\t  the interpolated grid. In this plot, we have reversed the sign of Ey in tailward flow to better distinguish earthward and \n\t  tailward transport. In addition, we have suppressed the overlays of flow direction and plasma pressure. This corresponds to the \n\t  rate of sunward transport of magnetic flux. At the start of the movie, the fast flow channels are transporting small amounts \n\t  of flux. At about 04:30 UT, this transport crosses the orbits of THEMIS spacecraft. Heavy black and white lines at >10 Re \n\t  pre-midnight depict the location of THEMIS spacecraft. A dashed black semi-circle defines \n\t  synchronous orbit. The Earth is a green half-circular patch. By this time, the color scale for Ey has \n\t  saturated. Note the highest rate of transport is near the edges of the channels. By 04:48 UT, it is obvious that the fast \n\t  flow channel is delivering flux at a very rapid rate to the inner edge of the plasma sheet.",
