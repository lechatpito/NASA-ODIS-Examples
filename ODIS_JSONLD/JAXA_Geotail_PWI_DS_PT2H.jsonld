  "description": "Geotail PWI SFA and MCA dynamic spectrogram plots with frequency in Hz on the vertical axis and time in UT on the horizontal axis. Each file contains one spectrogram from the electric field antennas and one from the magnetic field search coils. The electric field spectrograms span the frequency range 5.62 to 24 Hz (the Multi-Channel Analyzer - MCA instrument) and 24 Hz to 800 kHz (the Sweep Frequency Analyzer - SFA instrument). The intensity values are color coded and are expressed in units of dBV/m/root-Hz. The magnetic field spectrograms also combine the MCA and SFA instruments and span the frequency range 5.62 Hz to 12.5 kHz. The intensity values are color coded and are expressed in units of dB nT/root-Hz. Each plot spans 2 hours. Information on the instrument and antenna status is also provided above each spectrogram.",
