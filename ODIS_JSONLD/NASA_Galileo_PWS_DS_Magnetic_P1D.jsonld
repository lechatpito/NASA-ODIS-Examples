  "description": "These PWS daily spectrograms cover the time range around the time of the Galileo spacecraft's two Earth flybys on its way to Jupiter. This dataset contains magnetic field spectrograms in units of magnetic field spectral density (nT^2/Hz) spanning 6 Hz to 75 kHz. An associated dataset contains electric field spectrograms in units of electric field spectral density (V^2/m^2/Hz) spanning 6 Hz to 5.6 MHz. The sources of this browse data set are the High Frequency Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum Analyzer which make up the Low Rate Science portion of the PWS. The high frequency receiver data that appears in the uppermost panel of the spectrograms are only taken from the electric field antennas. During the time interval spanned by the first Earth flyby, Galileo approached Earth from the local early morning sector, made a close approach to Earth by passing through the magnetosphere, plasmasphere, ionosphere, and finally exited the Earth system in the local late morning. During the time interval spanned by the second Earth flyby, Galileo approached Earth from the local late evening sector, made a close approach to Earth by passing through the magnetosphere, plasmasphere, ionosphere, and finally exited the Earth system near local dawn. +-----------------------------------------------------+ Flyby 1 1990 November 8 1700 UT - dataset start 1990 December 8 - Earth closest approach 1990 December 18 1700 UT - dataset end +-----------------------------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------------------------+ Flyby 2 1992 November 6 2100 UT - dataset start 1992 December 8 - Earth closest approach 1992 December 17 0630 UT - dataset ends +-----------------------------------------------------+",
